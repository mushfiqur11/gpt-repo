# GPT Repository

This repository contains code for working with GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI.

## Introduction

GPT is a powerful language model that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It has been trained on a large corpus of text data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add a file named '.env' and add your 'OPENAI_API_KEY' to it. You can also add a file named 'OPENAI_API_KEY' and add the key to the file
4. Update the prompt in the 'gpt_prompt.yaml' file
5. Make other necessary updates to 'gpt_config.yaml' file
6. Run the code samples provided in the repository to see GPT in action.

## Code Examples

Here are a few code examples to help you understand how to use GPT:
